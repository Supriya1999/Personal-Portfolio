First of all: CSS variables can have a global or local scope.

Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.

To create a variable with global scope, declare it inside the :root selector. The :root selector matches the document's root element.

To create a variable with local scope, declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
